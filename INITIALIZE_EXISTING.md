1. Codebase Analyzer Module

A comprehensive CodebaseAnalyzer class that can scan existing codebases
Support for multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
Detection of code entities, relationships, design patterns, and architectural decisions
Extraction of knowledge from documentation and comments

2. Command Line Interface

init command to initialize a project with an existing codebase
update command to refresh analysis when the codebase changes
list command to view all projects

3. Web Interface Integration

UI for adding a codebase to an existing project
UI for updating a codebase analysis
Display of codebase statistics and extracted knowledge
Knowledge graph browsing (decisions, patterns, entities, relationships)

4. API Endpoints

/api/project/<project_id>/analyze-codebase for analyzing/refreshing a codebase
/api/project/<project_id>/knowledge/<knowledge_type> for accessing knowledge
/api/project/<project_id>/settings for updating project settings

How It Works

Initializing a Project:

User points to an existing codebase directory
System scans the codebase, parsing code files
Knowledge is extracted and stored in the graph database and vector store
Statistics are generated and displayed to the user


Knowledge Extraction:

Code structures (classes, functions, modules) are identified
Relationships between entities are mapped
Design patterns are detected from code and comments
Architectural decisions are extracted from comments and documentation
Everything is stored in the knowledge graph for future reference


Maintaining Consistency:

When the user chats with the LLM, the system references this knowledge
New code generations are checked against the established patterns
Inconsistencies are flagged to the user.

This feature allows you to bootstrap ArchivistLLM with an existing codebase ( ArchiveAsyLLM itself was developed in this Ouroboros sort of way.) The system will maintain a deep understanding of your code structure, patterns, and decisions, ensuring that new LLM-generated code remains consistent with your architecture.

To get started with your own codebase, you can:

- Start the application: `python app.py`
- Create a new project via the web UI and specify your codebase path
- Let the system analyze your code
- Begin chatting with the LLM, which will now have knowledge of your codebase (or use the CLI.)
