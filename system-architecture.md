# ArchiveAsyLLM - System Architecture

## Overview

ArchiveAsyLLM is a framework designed to augment LLM conversations with a persistent knowledge graph that captures reasoning, patterns, and design decisions across multiple interactions. This helps maintain consistency over long-running projects and prevents LLMs from "forgetting" previous architectural choices.

## Core Components

### 1. Chat Interface
- Flask-based web application
- Simple prompt/response UI
- Artifact visualization
- Project/chat organization

### 2. LLM Interaction Layer
- Provider-agnostic API client (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- Prompt construction with context enhancement
- Response parsing and extraction

### 3. Memory System
- Knowledge graph database (Neo4j or similar)
- Vector database for semantic search (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)
- Extraction engine for decisions/patterns/reasoning

### 4. Diff Analyzer
- Compare generations to identify changes
- Reasoning validation against prior knowledge
- Consistency checker with alerting

### 5. Configuration System
- Project-specific settings
- Chat-specific parameters
- LLM provider configuration
- Memory system tuning

## Data Flow

1. User submits prompt via Chat Interface
2. System retrieves relevant context from Memory System
3. Enhanced prompt sent to LLM via Interaction Layer
4. Response processed by Diff Analyzer
5. New knowledge extracted and stored in Memory System
6. Response with annotations returned to user

## Knowledge Representation

The knowledge graph will capture:

- **Entities**: Functions, classes, variables, concepts
- **Relationships**: Dependencies, uses, implements, extends
- **Attributes**: Purpose, reasoning, constraints, patterns
- **Decisions**: Why specific approaches were chosen
- **Patterns**: Recurring structures or idioms

## Usage Patterns

### Project Initialization
When starting a new project, the system captures initial design decisions and overall architecture goals.

### Iterative Development
During ongoing development, the system validates new changes against established patterns and flags potential inconsistencies.

### Knowledge Discovery
The system can be queried directly to explain why certain decisions were made or how components relate to each other.

### Architectural Enforcement
The system can suggest corrections when new generations deviate from established patterns without explicit reasoning.
